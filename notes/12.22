# Think in terms of objects

* Can be a story object
      -- can have attributes like Title, Author, keywords (tags), 
      -- constructors and getters and setters for all fields
      -- object holds all the info
      -- create instances of stories, which will include all the required information
      
* How to store my objects? 
      -- Something in Collections
      -- Hashmaps? key: identifying ID, value: instance of object
      -- So when you click on whichever book, if calls it by ID.
      
* Need to re-work diagram

* MVC format 
      -- Model: story objects
      -- View: front end
      -- Controller: back end
