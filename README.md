# The Seuss Emporium

The Seuss Emporium is an application that lets a user find a children's story based on thematic approaches. Want a story about protagonist transformation? Here you go. How about a story centered around conquering fear? There's a story right here!

So, if it's story time and your little one (or you!) wants the perfect story? Time to consult The Seuss Emporium.

My MVP will allow a user to search a database of stories and view each one's themes, or search by theme and view all the corresponding stories. The user then will be provided a link to the story online.

I will use Spring Boot, Maven, Java, SQL DB, and Angular.
