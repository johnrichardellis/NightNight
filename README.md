# NightNight

* NightNight is an application that lets a user find a children’s story that fits his or her desires based on user specified criteria. Is your child into dragons? No problem—here’s a story with a dragon. Or would you rather hear something featuring a genie? Here you go. Never again will you have to rack your brain or peruse the bookshelf for the perfect story—it’s all right here. 

* So, if it’s bedtime and your little one wants the perfect story? It’s NightNight time.

* My MVP will allow a user to filter through a database of stories based on unique characteristics of each and NightNight will provide a link to the perfect story, just in time for bedtime. 

* I will use Spring Boot, Java, SQL DB, and Angular.
